# Project Description
With all the subscription services available these days, it can be very hard to keep track of what you are subscribed to. Even worse, people often end up paying for things they don’t actually want, simply because they forget that they have signed up for a recurring payment with a subscription service. Let’s build an app that will help people manage their subscriptions, and cancel those ones they would have otherwise forgot about.

## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to help people keep track of all their online subscriptions. Our target crowd is anyone who is having trouble keeping track of their online subscriptions. Our app will be able to display and calculate general statistics for the target customer's subscription. A user should be able to log in, check out every subscription they have, see monthly costs, add/delete new subscriptions, and cancel subscriptions. 

## History

Zach had way too much subscription service to keep track of. Therefore, he wanted to create his app to make his life a little easier. Therefore, the idea of Subtrackt is born.
