Team Norms:

	1.Team Values
 	Be open to everyone on the team and give everyone a change to speak
	Help people who are struggling as much as you can
	Dont be afraid to ask for help
	
	2.Sprint Cadence
	Two weeks

	3.Daily Standups
	We can do Wednesday evenings after 6
	Mondays after 6 as well
	They will last for one hour and thirty minutes 

	4.Coding standards: Designate a code editor and code linter all team members will use to standardize code formatting.
	Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.
	Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
	Provide descriptive commit messages.
	Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
	Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
	Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).
	
Git Workflow:
	
	When working on shared files, create a seperate branch, and when 
	working on stand-alone files edit directly (README)

	Always have another team member review the pull request before 
	pushing to the project. 

Rules of Contribution:

	Please do your work honestly and timely
	Communicate clearly about your intentions
	and where you see the direction heading. 
	Expriment on your own branch! Just trying to update
	the team as much as possible
